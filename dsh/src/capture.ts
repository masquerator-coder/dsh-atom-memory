/**
 * Durable capture hooks.
 *
 * These hooks turn conversation into memory automatically and, crucially,
 * rescue facts that would otherwise be lost:
 *
 *  1. **Per-message capture** — `user/message` durable events whose text
 *     carries a fact-worthy signal are submitted for extraction
 *     immediately. Every direct user message is captured; whether it becomes
 *     a fact is decided downstream by the LLM extractor (or rule fallback),
 *     not by a brittle keyword gate.
 *  2. **Pre-compression rescue** — when the context window is about to be
 *     compacted (`llm/stream` with `purpose: 'compaction'`), the session's
 *     recent not-yet-stored user messages are re-scanned and saved *before*
 *     compression so key facts survive the fold. The hook always calls
 *     `next()` — compression is never blocked.
 *  3. **Periodic nudge** — a timer periodically re-scans recent direct user
 *     messages so facts the LLM was too busy to save are not lost.
 *
 * The per-session "recent messages" buffer is fed only from durable
 * `user/message` session events (which dsh logs and can replay), so the memory
 * written back is reproducible from the session log — it never reads live,
 * non-replayable coordination state.
 *
 * `captureEnabled` is consulted **at each hook invocation** rather than captured
 * at registration: the settings switch is meant to stop capture immediately
 * (that is the point of turning it off), and a hook that was wired at load time
 * could not honour that.
 *
 * Every dispatch is best-effort: a capture failure never throws into the loop.
 *
