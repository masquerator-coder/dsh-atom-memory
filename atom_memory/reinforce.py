"""Reuse reinforcement: saturating strengthening of frequently-used memories.

Facts are not equally valuable forever, and they are not equally valuable
because the extractor happened to score them 0.85 at write time. A fact the
user keeps re-stating (or keeps relying on) is more worth remembering than one
seen exactly once. This module turns that "reuse evidence" into an *effective*
importance, without letting repetition run away.

Design
------

A reinforcement event carries a **gain** (how strong the evidence is). Events
are folded into a single float, ``n`` ("effective reinforcement count"), which
feeds a saturating curve::

    A(n) = A_MAX * (1 - exp(-LAMBDA * n))

The curve is chosen to be simultaneously **locally linear** and **globally
bounded**:

- at ``n = 0`` the derivative equals ``A_MAX * LAMBDA``, its maximum over the
  whole domain, and for small ``n`` the curve is nearly straight
  (``1 - exp(-x) ~ x``): the first few reuses each add a comparable amount;
- the derivative decays monotonically to zero, so every further reuse adds
  strictly less than the previous one (diminishing marginal effect);
- ``A`` is bounded by ``A_MAX`` for all ``n``, so no amount of reuse can push a
  fact past the ceiling and permanently monopolise retrieval. A pure linear
  ``base + k * n`` has neither property: it is unbounded and gives the 100th
  reuse the same weight as the 1st.

The final score is ``clamp(base + A(n), 0, 1)`` where ``base`` is the
extractor's original ``importance``. Reinforcement only ever *adds* to that
baseline and is capped below 1.0, so reuse ordering can never invert the
written-down ordering of two facts that differ by more than ``A_MAX``.

Time is the second half of the design. Reuse without forgetting still
accumulates monotonically, so ``n`` is not a plain counter: it *decays*
exponentially with a half-life ``HALF_LIFE_DAYS`` and is topped up by each new
event::

    n <- n * exp(-LAMBDA_T * elapsed_days) + gain

This is what makes repeated use meaningful: the same number of events spread
over months outweighs a burst confined to one session, and a memory that stops
being used fades on its own (the "use it or lose it" half of the Ebbinghaus
picture). ``last_used_at`` is therefore *also* the better age signal for
recency ranking than ``created_at``: a long-lived but actively used fact should
not be aged out merely for being old.

State versus strength: one derivation, one place
-----------------------------------------------

The decay above is a *continuous* process but the database can only hold
discrete snapshots, so the two are kept rigorously apart:

- ``facts.reinforce_count`` + ``facts.last_used_at`` are **state**: a snapshot
  taken at the last event that passed the cooldown gate.
- ``effective_importance`` is **derived**, always, by decaying that snapshot to
  the instant being asked about (:func:`adjust` then
  :func:`effective_importance`).

Nothing may treat the snapshot as the current value. Doing so was a real defect:
a fact reinforced once and then untouched for a year kept reporting its
year-old strength forever, so "reuse decays" was true of the formula and false
of every number the system actually showed. Every reader therefore goes through
:func:`effective_importance_at` (or :func:`adjust` when it has several facts and
one reference instant), and the persisted columns are never interpreted as
strength.

There is exactly one decay function in this module and one saturating curve; the
persistence layer composes them and adds nothing of its own. That is deliberate:
the earlier shape let the write path store a partially-decayed value "as the
counter and the readers trust it as strength, which is precisely how the state and
the strength drifted apart.

What does **not** count
-----------------------

Retrieval hits are deliberately *not* a reinforcement signal. Feeding recall
back into the score creates a rich-get-richer loop in which a fact that merely
matched one query's wording gets easier to match forever. Only evidence that
the fact was genuinely reused counts, banded in :data:`KIND_GAINS`:

======================  ======  ==========================================
kind                    gain    evidence
======================  ======  ==========================================
``user_confirmed``      1.0     the user explicitly confirmed the fact
``user_restated``       0.8     the same claim was stated again, later
``applied``             0.6     the fact demonstrably shaped an answer
``retrieved_only``      0.0     mere recall: recorded, never strengthens
======================  ======  ==========================================

Anti-abuse is structural rather than ad hoc:

- **Idempotency** is enforced by a UNIQUE index on
  ``(user_id, session_id, fact_id, kind)``, so a claim restated five times in
  one session yields exactly one event.
- **Cooldown** (``COOLDOWN_SEC``) suppresses the gain when events arrive back to
  back, and the clock it measures from only advances on events that passed the
  gate. A duplicate therefore cannot preserve strength (the decay still applies)
  and cannot slide the window forward to lock a fact out of future
  reinforcement.
- **Replayability**: ``roll`` is a pure function of
  ``(n, last_used_at, gain, event_at)``, so ``fact_reinforcements`` recomputes the
  stored state exactly — which is what makes retuning ``A_MAX`` /
  ``HALF_LIFE_DAYS`` retro-applicable and suspected abuse auditable.

All functions here are pure; persistence lives in :func:`record_reinforcement`
and :func:`rebuild_fact_reinforcement`.

    Replays ``fact_reinforcements`` in chronological order. Because ``roll`` is
    purely a function of the prior state — and because both the decay and the
    cooldown are dated from the last event that *counted* — this reproduces
    what the incremental path produced for the same history. That is what makes
    a retuned ``A_MAX`` / ``HALF_LIFE_DAYS`` retro-applicable, and any suspected
    abuse correctable, without trusting the stored aggregate.

    The replay yields the state **as of the last counted event**, and that is
    exactly what the column is defined to hold: ``adjust`` documents
    ``facts.reinforce_count`` as "the value as of ``last_used_at``, not now",
    and every reader decays it forward from there. Persisting a
    now-decayed value instead would double-count the elapsed decay — the row
    would age once on write and again on every read.
