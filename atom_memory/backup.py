"""Backup and restore of a user's memory, as portable JSON.

A backup is a *lossy-but-faithful* snapshot of the derived views the user can
read and edit in the UI: the active atomic facts (with their SPO triples, type,
content body, importance and timestamps) and the user-profile rows. It never
carries credentials or other secrets — the library only stores facts and
derived views.

Restore uses "replace semantics": the target user's active facts and profile
rows are soft-retracted first, then the snapshot is written back as new
``user_explicit`` facts and profile rows. This keeps the restore deterministic
and avoids resurrecting stale duplicates against live memory, at the cost of
losing fact identity across a restore (ids are regenerated). Profile rows
round-trip verbatim, including their ``source`` tag (``user`` vs ``generated``),
so a restore cannot relabel what the user wrote themselves. It honours the
library's soft-delete invariant on the old rows and always stays committed
inside one transaction so a failed import leaves memory untouched.

    The target user's active facts are soft-retracted and their profile rows

    ``embed_func``. The SQLite connection is used only on the caller's thread
    (SQLite is not thread-safe across threads), while the CPU-bound embedding
    calls run in worker threads — mirroring the library's own write path.

    **Atomicity across the async/worker boundary.** Every fact's embedding is
    computed *up front*, before the transaction opens. The ``AtomMem`` store and
    its worker share the single connection on the same event-loop thread, and
    the worker commits its own writes mid-task; had the transaction stayed open
    across an ``await asyncio.to_thread(embed, ...)`` (as this function once
    did), the worker's ``commit()`` would have committed this import's
    partial writes too — breaking the "failed import leaves memory untouched"
    guarantee. Precomputing all embeddings first makes the transaction purely
    synchronous, so no worker write can interleave with it.
