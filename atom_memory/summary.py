"""Generate a user's ``summary`` from active atomic facts.

``summary`` is a *derived view* over the authoritative facts table, rendered at
two depths from one implementation:

- **compact** (``detail=False``) — what the dsh host freezes into the session
  system prompt. Facts are grouped by memory type, semantic attributes collapse
  to ``predicate: value`` one-liners and multi-valued ones fold into a single
  line, so the whole picture fits a small token budget. No ``fact_id``: the long
  UUIDs cost more tokens than they carry information for the model, and every
  fact stays addressable through ``recall`` and the settings editor.
- **detail** (``detail=True``) — the full list, one bullet per fact with its
  ``fact_id``, used by the ``memory_summary_detail`` tool and the settings modal.

Ordering blends **importance and recency** into one score (see
:func:`_blend`): a fact's ``importance`` only counts when the extractor actually
supplied a signal; the neutral default (:data:`NEUTRAL_SCORE`) means "unknown"
and falls back to the type's default rank
(:func:`~atom_memory.models.default_importance`). Without that fallback every
fact ties at 0.5 and the order degenerates to plain recency.

Recency is a real dimension rather than a tie-break, because a memory view is
read at whatever budget the user configured: when the budget is tight, whatever
the ordering puts last is what gets dropped. Ranking by importance alone would
therefore always sacrifice the newest material — a fact recorded minutes ago
would lose to durable knowledge from months back — which is exactly the wrong
trade for "what is going on right now". The blend keeps importance primary
while letting a sufficiently fresh fact outrank a stale one.

The budget is spent **globally best-first** (:func:`_select`), not
section-by-section: trimming a whole low-priority section before touching any
line of a high-priority one would discard a top-scoring fresh fact merely
because it lives in the section that sorts last.

#
# One score per fact decides both the render order and (through it) what a tight

# rather than magic numbers inline: they are the one knob that trades "durable
# knowledge stays" against "what just happened gets in".

# should: "the newest thing I know" always gets full recency credit, and
# everything else is discounted by how much older it is than that.
#
# The name says "seconds" but the value is in **milliseconds**, matching the
# timestamps it divides (every `*_at` column is ms). It is spelled that way for
# backward compatibility; db.recency_credit is unit-agnostic and takes whatever
# the caller passes, so the only thing that must hold is that this and the age
# share a unit.
#
# The anchor deliberately differs from the retriever's: this view renders one
# user's whole memory, so the newest memory is exactly the right definition of
# "now". The retriever sees a handful of query-matched candidates and caps its
# reference offset with a window instead, because one very fresh candidate would
# otherwise make every other candidate look ancient. Only the anchor and the

    On overflow the artifact is shrunk one line at a time, always giving up the
    **globally lowest-scoring** line still present, until it fits. Two properties
    follow, and both matter:

    * The surviving set is "the most important and most recent memory" at *any*
      budget. The previous implementation instead emptied one section after
      another from the tail, so a top-scoring fact recorded minutes ago could be

    * The budget is measured on the **assembled artifact** — the body plus the
      footer that this very selection produces — never on an estimate of its
      parts, so the token budget is a hard cap on what is actually returned.

    A section that loses *every* line loses its label too (labels are part of the
    artifact being measured), so no bare ``流程`` stub is rendered.

    Cost is linear-ish rather than quadratic: the candidate order is fixed once,
    and each removal updates the artifact's *character totals* instead of
    re-rendering it. ``estimate_tokens`` is a pure function of those totals
    (``cjk + max(other // 5, 1)``), so the incremental measurement is exactly
    what a full re-render would report — which the differential test in
    ``tests/test_summary.py`` pins. Re-measuring the whole artifact per dropped
    line cost O(n²): 3000 facts took 8.2 s *inside* prompt assembly, blocking
    every other request on the same event loop.
