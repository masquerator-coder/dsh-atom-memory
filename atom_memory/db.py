#
# Every time-based credit in the library is one shape: an exponential decay with
# a half-life. It lives here, next to :func:`now_ms`, because this module is
# already the single authority on what a timestamp means, and because both
# consumers (the retriever's ranking and ``summary``'s budget allocation) must
# agree on the shape even though they tune different half-lives. The alternative
# — a per-query min-max normalisation of ages — is what this replaces: it
# rescales the candidate set so the best fact scores 1.0 and the worst 0.0
# *whatever the actual spread is*, which means two facts written milliseconds
# apart inside one session are treated as maximally different in age, and one
# ancient outlier makes everything else maximally fresh.

    **Units are whatever the caller passes, as long as they match.** ``age``,

    library's timestamps are milliseconds; callers that already have seconds work
    in seconds). The function deliberately does no conversion of its own: a
    silent ms/s mismatch is invisible in a formula and produces plausible-looking
    numbers, so the unit is the caller's single source of truth.

    Args:
        age: How old the item is, measured against the same clock as every other
            item in the set.

    Recency is *relative*: the newest item in a set defines "current", because a
    wall-clock age cannot be compared meaningfully against other items in the
    same result set (see :mod:`~atom_memory.retriever` for why). So ages are
    shifted so that the newest item becomes ``0``, and the shift is capped at
    ``window``.

    The cap is what prevents the opposite failure: if the newest item is itself
    very old, an uncapped shift would push every item past the clamp and hand
    them all identical full credit, silently switching the recency term off.
