"""Tests for reuse reinforcement (``reinforce.py`` + migration 005).

The point of this module is a *shape*, so the invariant tests come first: the
strengthening must be locally linear, globally bounded, and concave (each extra
reuse counts less than the one before). Everything after that checks the two
things a curve alone cannot give you — that only genuine reuse counts, and that
repeated evidence cannot be manufactured inside one session.
